Create a shell script to check whether Content from one list is present in another list or not

Sure, here's a shell script that will check if the content from one list is present in another list or not:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Define two lists
list1=("apple" "banana" "cherry" "date")
list2=("cherry" "date" "fig" "grape")

# Loop through each element in list1
for i in "${list1[@]}"
do
    # Check if the element is present in list2
    if [[ "${list2[*]}" =~ "$i" ]]
    then
        echo "$i is present in list2"
    else
        echo "$i is not present in list2"
    fi
done
In this script, we have defined two lists, list1 and list2, and we are looping through each element in list1. For each element in list1, we are checking if it is present in list2 using the =~ operator in the if statement. If the element is present in list2, we print a message saying it is present, otherwise, we print a message saying it is not present.

You can modify the script by replacing the elements in list1 and list2 with your own lists, and run it on your local machine by saving it in a file with a .sh extension, making it executable using chmod +x script.sh, and running it with ./script.sh.

In the first list I have policycodes in random order.. In second list I have policycodes in arranged order.. I want to check if policycodes from first list is present in second list or not.. if yes then arrange thoes in second list order

Sure, here's an updated script that will check if the policy codes from the first list are present in the second list and if so, arrange them in the same order as the second list:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Define two lists
list1=("PC002" "PC001" "PC005" "PC003")
list2=("PC001" "PC002" "PC003" "PC004" "PC005")

# Loop through each element in list1
for i in "${list1[@]}"
do
    # Check if the element is present in list2
    if [[ "${list2[*]}" =~ "$i" ]]
    then
        # If present, add it to a new array in the order of list2
        new_list+=("$i")
    fi
done

# Print the new list
echo "${new_list[@]}"



/bin/bash

# Define two lists

list1=("C0001" "PC002" "PC001" "PC005" "PC003")

list2=("PC001" "PC002" "PC003" "PC004" "PC005")

# Get the customer id from the first list

customer_id=${list1[0]}

# Loop through each element in list1 starting from index 1

for i in "${list1[@]:1}"

do

    # Check if the element is present in list2

    if [[ "${list2[*]}" =~ "$i" ]]

    then

        # If present, add it to a new array in the order of list2

        new_list+=("$i")

    fi

done

# Put the customer id at the beginning of the new list

new_list=("$customer_id" "${new_list[@]}")

# Print the first five elements of the new list

echo "${new_list[@]:0:5}"

In this script, we have defined two lists, list1 and list2, and we are getting the customer id from the first element of list1. We then loop through each element in list1 starting from index 1, and for each element that is present in list2, we add it to a new array new_list in the order of list2.

Finally, we put the customer id at the beginning of new_list and print the first five elements of new_list.

You can modify the script by replacing the elements in list1 and list2 with your own lists and run it on your local machine by saving it in a file with a .sh extension, making it executable using chmod +x script.sh, and running it with ./script.sh.

we add it to a new array new_list in the order of list2 please explain how code will achieve this

Sure, here's how the script will achieve adding the policy codes from list1 that are present in list2 to a new array new_list in the order of list2:

We define an empty new_list array at the beginning of the script: new_list=()

Inside the loop that iterates over the elements of list1, we use the =~ operator to check if the current element is present in list2.

If the element is present in list2, we add it to the new_list array using the += operator: new_list+=("$i"). This adds the current element to the end of the new_list array.

At the end of the loop, new_list contains all the policy codes from list1 that are present in list2, but they may not be in the order of list2.

To put the policy codes in the order of list2, we can modify the loop to iterate over the elements of list2 instead of list1, and use another loop to check if each element of list2 is present in list1 and add it to new_list in the order of list2. However, this would require a nested loop and could be less efficient if list1 and list2 are large.




we can modify the loop to iterate over the elements of list2 instead of list1, and use another loop to check if each element of list2 is present in list1 and add it to new_list in the order of 



Instead, we can use the += operator to add elements to new_list in the order of list2 by using the ${new_list[*]} syntax to expand new_list as a space-separated string, and then using the += operator to append the current element to new_list in the order of list2: new_list+=("$i"). This adds the current element to the end of new_list, but in the order of list2 because we are appending it after all the elements of new_list that are already in list2 order.

Overall, this approach allows us to add the policy codes from list1 to new_list in the order of list2 without the need for a nested loop.

                new_list+=("${list1[$j]}")

    # Add the new line to the target CSV file

    echo "$new_line" >> target.csv

done < "$csv_file"

In this modified script, we first create the target CSV file with a header using the echo command: echo "Customer ID, Policy Code 1, Policy Code 2, Policy Code 3, Policy Code 4" > target.csv. This creates a new file called target.csv and writes the header to it.

We then modify the loop to create a new line for the target CSV file using new_line="$customer_id,${new_list[@]:0:4}", which concatenates the customer ID with the first four policy codes in the order of list2 separated by commas. Finally, we add the new line to the target CSV file using echo "$new_line" >> target.csv.

With this modification, the script will write the customer ID and first four policy codes in the order of list2 for each line in the input CSV file to a new CSV file called target.csv.

            writer.writerow(new_row)

Note that in Python, we use the csv module to read and write CSV files, and we use a with statement to ensure that the files are properly closed after we are done with them. We also use lists instead of arrays to store the policy codes, and we use the enumerate() function to loop through a list while keeping track of the index.










Run Command from Variable

prasadswami76@gmail.com

I have one command stored as a variable I want to run that command in shell script how to do that

To run a command stored in a variable in a shell script, you can use the eval command in Bash. The eval command allows you to evaluate a command that is stored in a string variable as if it were a regular command.

Here's an example:

bash

Copy code

#!/bin/bash

# Store the command in a variable

cmd="ls -l"

# Use eval to run the command

eval $cmd

In this example, the ls -l command is stored in the cmd variable. The eval command is then used to run the command stored in the cmd variable.

Note that using eval can be dangerous if the contents of the variable are not properly sanitized, as it can execute arbitrary commands. Make sure that the variable only contains a valid command that you want to run.







You're right. Here's an updated version of the script that can handle a variable number of CSV files provided as a single argument, including the case where only one CSV file is provided:

bash

Copy code

#!/bin/bash

# check that one argument has been provided

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then

    echo "Usage: $0 <csv1 csv2 csv3 ...>"

    exit 1

fi

# split the argument into an array of CSV filenames

IFS=' ' read -r -a files <<< "$1"

# check that all files are CSV files

for file in "${files[@]}"; do

    if [ ! -f "$file" ] || [ "${file##*.}" != "csv" ]; then

        echo "$file is not a CSV file"

        exit 1

    fi

done

# append all CSV files to the first one

first_file="${files[0]}"

for file in "${files[@]:1}"; do

    cat "$file" >> "$first_file"

done

Save this script to a file, for example append_csv.sh, and make it executable with the command chmod +x append_csv.sh.

To use the script, run it with the names of the CSV files as a single argument separated by spaces, like this:

bash

Copy code

./append_csv.sh "csv1.csv csv2.csv csv3.csv"

The script will split the argument into an array of CSV filenames, check that all files are CSV files, and append the contents of all CSV files to the first one in the order they are provided. If only one CSV file is provided, the script will simply exit without appending anything.
